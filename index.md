## 🛡️ Trust & Security at ScionX

### On-Chain, On-Point

Every transaction on ScionX is transparently recorded on-chain. Even before KYC, buyer and seller wallet addresses are visible — empowering users to verify before they trust.

### Real-Time Risk Controls

ScionX runs automated checks to detect unusual patterns. From wallet reputation scoring to anomaly detection, we help flag fraud before it happens.

### Fraud Prevention = Community First

Spot something off? Report it instantly in your dashboard. Our internal blacklist, powered by community reports and analytics, keeps repeat offenders out of the ecosystem.

### Border-Aware by Design

Users in sanctioned or restricted regions are automatically geo-fenced and blocked from transacting. We build with global compliance in mind — so you don’t have to.

### Smart Access Tools for Merchants

Want to limit access? You can:

• Require wallet login or email sign-in

• Geofence offers by region or country

### Finality with Flexibility

Crypto payments are irreversible once confirmed on-chain. Refunds — if applicable — are always handled directly between buyer and merchant. ScionX stays non-custodial, so you stay in control.

### Security Isn’t a Feature. It’s the Foundation.

From smart contract audits to multi-sig treasury support, ScionX is built with a security-first mindset across every layer of our stack.
